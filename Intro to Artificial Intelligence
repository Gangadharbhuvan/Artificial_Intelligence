Almost Everyone heard about Artifical Intelligence, But dont no properly what is it....?

What is AI?
   AI-Artificial Intelligence is about augumenting(developing) human intelligence by providing information and evidence
   that subject matter experts need to make informed decisions. AI uses mathematical algorithm to examine example and 
   create machine learning models based on input and desired output.


There are different types of learning for AI......So there are mainly 3 different types, They are...
  1.Supervised Learning
  2.Unsupervised Learning
  3.Reinforcement Learning
  AI learns by examining examples to create Machine Learing(Which will be Explained Later) models based on provided input and desired
  goals. And it does in this 3 different ways.
  
  
AI can be described in 3 differnt ways based on Strength, Breadth, and  Application
  1.Weak or Narrow AI-->This AI is applied to a specific domain, like Eg-Language Translation, Virtual Assitants, Self Driving Cars, 
                        Applied AI can perform specific task, but not learn new ones, and can make decision based on programmed algorithm
                        and trained data.
  2.Strong AI or Generalized AI-->This AI can interact and operate a wide variety of independent and unrelated tasks. It can learn new 
                                  tasks to solve new problems. And it does this by teaching itself new Strategies.
                                  Generalized AI is combination of many AI strategies that learn from experience and can pergorm at a
                                  Human Level Intelligence.
  3.Super AI or Conscious AI-->  This AI with human level consciousness, which would require it to be self aware. Because we are not yet 
                                 able to adequate define what consciousness is, it is unlikely that we will be able to create a 
                                 consciousness AI in near future.
